<h1>Mapchat Security Report</h1>

<p> Grant Pemberton </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://damp-caverns-4167.herokuapp.com/">Mapchat</a> and the "mapchat server" are components of a geographical tracker and check in system for members of the Fall 2015 CS 20 class. This application keeps track of users’ logins, locations, and messages using MongoDB. The client side of this application is the mapchat page (javascript). This page shows where on a map each user is, and what their message and login information is. By storing each user’s information in the mapchat server, one is able to run mapchat for the entire class locally. For this product, we have been hired to investigate any security or privacy flaws in the implementation of both the client side and serverside of mapchat. This comprehensive investigation will include static and dynamic testing using simple and complex techniques (additional software).</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Tools used in this security analysis were Sublime text and Curl. The webpage was tested for Cross Site Scripting, access to private keys for different users, and access to the database of users. Testing was first carried out black box style, and then reviewing the code revealed more issues.</p>

<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

<p> The server was vulnerable to the XSS attack. We were able to effectively break the server for mapchat by displaying an alert when the webpage was opened instead of checking in a new user. In addition to this security issue, it was possible to see the id associated with each user because it was stored with the data that was input into MongoDB. Similarly by returning a specific variable name, we were able to obtain a list of users that had acceptable logins. This list of accepted logins is probably the largest security flaw because one would be able to now fake their login information and gain unauthorized access to the system.</p>

<h2>Issues Found</h2>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Cross Site Scripting</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><span class="high">Severity: High</span></li>
<li>Cross site scripting is an issue in this code because it causes the website to perform in ways that the engineer did not intend. The cross site scripting issue is within the app.get/ portion of the code because that portion outputs the message that the user input. This issue is not very severe because it can be fixed very easily. Since the message is output into the html code that builds the site, by adding a script block within a message, one is able to make the html run a script that is not the original intent of the person who built the website. 

<li><p><strong>Enabling Cross Origin Resource Sharing</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Affects GET and POST API</li>
<li><span class="mod">Moderate</span></li>
<li> By allowing cross origin resource sharing, this site allows for sharing with every origin of the server. That means that a person with malicious intent could theoretically access the login information of every user for the website. This problem exists in both the get and post methods of the server construction. Cross origin resource sharing can be resolved by whitelisting trusted domains so that those who wish to steal information cannot access the application or its private data. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>MongoDB injection</strong></p>
<li>In POST API</li>
<li><span class="low">Low</span></li>
<li>By using Curl, one is able to access the entire database could reveal private information of other users. This is a serious privacy breach and it is a large problem with databases like mongo. By having a list of users, I could also spoof my user id and create a problem on the website that would lead back to the user that I spoofed. For this reason, it is important to keep this data private and only accessible to the admins. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The engineer for this application should sanitize their data to avoid XSS attacks, build off of a more secure database, and use cross origin resource sharing in a more secure manner by whitelisting only trusted sites instead of all sites. As this application is more widely used and the testing of this application continues to grow, these security and privacy vulnerabilities will be fixed. The modifications explained in this document should be implemented to create a more secure and private connection from the Mapchat application to the Mapchat server.</p>
