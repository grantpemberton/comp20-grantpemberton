It was very difficult to complete this assignment because github was not cooperating for a large majority of the primary stages of this project.
Also I got a very late start and did not manage my time well.

That being said, I was not able to implement black box testing well, however by analyzing the code I was able to verify that the problems stated in
the report are present within Josh's Assignment 3.

I reached out to Josh Berl to work on this project, but never got to actually work together with him.

This assignment took about 5 hours to complete.
