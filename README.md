This Git repository is a portfolio of my work for Comp 20 - Web Programming

My favorite assignment in this course was the client side mapchat application because it provided a strong example for how APIs are meant to be used. It demonstrated the power of APIs an reinforced the idea of not reinventing the wheel.

I have grown considerably during this course, my coding confidence and research abilities have grown the most, and I'm now inspired to venture out on my own to work on my own projects.

The most important thing that I learned in this class was that there is always someone who is going to use your application. Software is written for an audience of 0, 1, or n. For instance, many projects in Comp-11 and 15 were written for 1 user, however several assignments in Comp 20 were written for more than one user, thus they were written for n users. This idea is an important consideration when incorporating modularity and user experience into your design.

I would like to delve deeper into data management and database creation. I want to build web applications in the future that will help users with productivity, so to serve "n" users it's important to manage data in an efficient way.
