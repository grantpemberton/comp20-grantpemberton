 - The DuckHunt Background and two bird sprites are drawn using game.js
 - I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment
 - This took me about 2 hours

 -*Notes* - the wait function is to be used with animation of the ducks, but I have an exam tomorrow, so I will not continue to work on this until after that exam.
